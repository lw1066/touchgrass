# <span style="color:darkgreen"> TouchGrass </span>

TouchGrass is a mobile application to encourage users to explore their local area. Three trophies are randomly placed at interesting locations within a 5km radius of the location the user enters on sign-up. The user can then walk to those places to pick up the trophies using their device's camera. After they have collected all three, another three are dropped in new locations! In this way users are encourage to explore their local area and find the real treasures of new, exciting places in their neighbourhood.

## <span style="color:lightgreen">Tech-Stack</span>

TouchGrass was developed using a custom expo build on React Native. The build allowed us to integrate ViroAR and Google maps to provide the front-end display. Geoaplify API handled providing interesting locations to drop trophies. Firebase authorization and real-time database took care of the back-end.

We plan to secure sensitive API keys etc using Google cloud functions but have yet to implement this.

## <span style="color:lightgreen">Demo video</span>

Unfortunately, a demo app is not available to play with as API keys etc remain unsecured. Take a look round the code but any keys you may find are inactive.

If you'd like to see a video of the app in action and read a little more about it then please take a look at the [Demo Video](https://the-site-eight.vercel.app/touchgrass) on my site.
